Epicodus JavaScript Project Week 4 || Angular 2 Extended

### Specs
* Users will be able to add members
* Users will be able to edit and remove members
* Users will be able to filter members by experience
* Users will be able to view details of specific members


## Description
This project serves as practice with the Angular 2 Framework, more specifically: use of a router to navigate between pages, filtering data with pipes, using a service to share data between multiple components, CRUD functionality, and implementation of components. This web application will allow users to manage a club. In this case, I chose to manage a fictional club called Epicodus FC. Users will be able to add members to the club, edit their details, remove members from the club, and filter members by experience. This application is connected to Firebase so all entries will be saved through the cloud database.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
